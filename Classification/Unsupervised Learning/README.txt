	- Dataset 2 Testing Data: adult_testdata.csv

========== How to Replicate Results ===========
All my algorithms were run with Weka. 
Run the csvs on Weka Experimenter with the parameters as described in the analysis pdf.
For the Accuracy tests, run Explorer with different % Sample Size and press start to analyze the results with each algorithm. It will automatically give the ROC Curve %, Precision, Accuracy, and many more. Keep in mind for each % Sample Size, you have to rerun the explore function. 
To make plots, save each of the results from above in a CSV and plot with the performance metric indicated.
