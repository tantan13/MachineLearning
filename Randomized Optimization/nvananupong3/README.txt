========== File Structure ===========
	- The Analysis pdf, the file that contains the 10 pages of my report
	- Dataset : The Adult Dataset (National Consensus Data)
	- Code: nn_ro.py, the python code ran for the neural nets.

========== How to Replicate Results ===========
All my selected problems were run on ABIGAIL (https://github.com/pushkar/ABAGAIL)
I Ran the FourPeaksTest, the TravelingSalesmanTest, and the MaxKColoringTest. All I edited was I made a for loop to change the number of iterations and then put this in the pre-existing parameters for iterations.
Run the tests on Ant. 

For the Neural Network Learning, I used MLRose and Spyder to run my code. Code attached in zip file (nn_ro.py).

For the Plots, I used Excel to plot them with the data results from ABIGAIL and MLRose/Spyder generates data in files.
