	- Data and Code : https://github.com/juanjose49/omscs-cs7641-machine-learning-assignment-4 , https://github.com/jmacglashan/burlap (all source code credits to this personâ€™s GitHub, who made an extension of the Brown-UMBC Reinforcement Learning and Planning Library aka BURLAP. I simply made minor changes to his library for my own experiments such as reward functions and the grid worlds.)
